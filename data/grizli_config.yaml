pad: 1000 # Pad chosen to be >one full trace dx (make sure also includes size of object)
# The pad does not seem to have a large impact on compute times.
# It only needs to be larger than one full trace in x. It can be defined seperately in the x and y.

# The below values have need to be corrected:
# 1) Different methods for determining max dy return different results
# 2) These sizes do not account for size of objects, but only for maximum dy+10 on the detector; Ashley increased each by ~10% after seeing a number of messages about dispersion going outside of bounds.
# These sizes do have a significant impact on compute times and should be minimized as much as possible.
